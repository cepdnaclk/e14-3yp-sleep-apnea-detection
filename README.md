# Sleep Apnea Detection

## Objective
Developing a 100% non intrusive method for detecting sleep apnea in infants.

## Approach
A video feed is processed to detect the breathing pattern and then it is assessed for anomalies.

### Algorithms
Canny edge detection, Center of graviry tracking, subspace filtering, adaptive filtering, maxima detection.

### Hardware
Raspberry pi model 3 b
Raspberry pi camera

### Software
Python3, OpenCV

## People
[Gihan Jayatilaka](http://gihan.me) , [Harshana Weligampola](http://teambitecode.com/people/harshana) , [Suren Sritharan](http://teambitecode.com/people/suren) and [Pankayaraj Pathmanathan](http://teambitecode.com/people/pankayraj) developed this system as a course project for CO321 CO323 CO325.
The project was supervised by [Dr. Roshan Ragel](http://roshan.ragel.net) and [Dr.Isuru Nawinne](mailto:isurunawinne@gmail.com) .
The embedded system was developed by [Nuwan Jaliyagoda](http://teambitecode.com/people/nuwan) and [Anupamali Willamuna](http://teambitecode.com/people/anupamali).

## Acknowledgements
[Sanjaya Herath](mailto:slh.1995@gmail.com) provided the hardware components. [Dinidu Bhathiya](mailto:Dinidu.Bhathiya@syscolabs.com) provided a dataset. 

### Future work (ideas)
1. Identifying deafness in infants through behavioural analytics
2. Identify risky behaviour of the baby (trying to climb out of the cot)
